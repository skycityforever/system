This is the official PyTorch implementation of **CAWM-Mamba**, the first end-to-end framework that jointly performs image fusion and compound weather restoration. CAWM-Mamba integrates three key components: (1) **Weather-Aware Preprocess Module (WAPM)** to enhance degraded features; (2) **Cross-modal Feature Interaction Module (CFIM)** to facilitate modality alignment; and (3) **Wavelet Space State Block (WSSB)** to decouple multi-frequency degradations.

## 📖 Abstract

Multimodal Image Fusion (MMIF) integrates complementary information from various modalities to produce clearer and more informative fused images. MMIF under adverse weather is particularly crucial in autonomous driving and UAV monitoring applications. However, existing adverse weather fusion methods generally only tackle single types of degradation such as haze, rain, or snow, and fail when multiple degradations coexist (e.g., haze&rain, rain&snow). To address this challenge, we propose **Compound Adverse Weather Mamba (CAWM-Mamba)**, the first end-to-end framework that jointly performs image fusion and compound weather restoration with unified shared weights. Our network contains three key components: (1) a **Weather-Aware Preprocess Module (WAPM)** to enhance degraded visible features and extract global weather embeddings; (2) a **Cross-modal Feature Interaction Module (CFIM)** to facilitate the alignment of heterogeneous modalities and exchange of complementary features across modalities; and (3) a **Wavelet Space State Block (WSSB)** that leverages wavelet-domain decomposition to decouple multi-frequency degradations. WSSB includes Freq-SSM, a module that models anisotropic high-frequency degradation without redundancy, and a unified degradation representation mechanism to further improve generalization across complex compound weather conditions. Extensive experiments on the AWMM-100K benchmark and three standard fusion datasets demonstrate that CAWM-Mamba consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both compound and single-weather scenarios. In addition, our fusion results excel in downstream tasks covering semantic segmentation and object detection, confirming the practical value in real-world adverse weather perception.

## 📉 Loss Functions

The project uses a comprehensive multi-component fusion loss function (`fusion_loss_vif`) implemented in [losses/losses.py](losses/losses.py):

- **Intensity Loss** (`L_Inten`): Preserves intensity information from both modalities
- **Gradient Loss** (`L_Grad`): Maintains edge and structural details
- **SSIM Loss** (`L_SSIM`): Ensures structural similarity with source images
- **Color Loss** (`L_color2`): Preserves color information in RGB space
- **Perceptual Loss**: Deep feature-based perceptual quality using pretrained networks
- **Wavelet Loss** (`WaveletLoss`): Multi-scale frequency-domain analysis with learnable weights

The final loss is computed as a weighted combination of all components for optimal multi-modal image fusion.
